# quiz-app
This is the last project from the free beginner React course from Scrimba. It is a quiz app that uses the open trivia database to retrieve a random selection of trivia questions. The user will be presented with a list of possible answers for each question and must choose the right one to win.
The design is based on this Figma file: https://www.figma.com/file/E9S5iPcm10f0RIHK8mCqKL/Quizzical-App?node-id=0%3A1
